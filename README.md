# paint_project 🎨 

🟥 This desktop application lets the user generate a selected number of random shapes.

🟦 The user can save/load the current set of shapes for durability. Anytime later, they can open the existing set to generate shapes (the same shape with randomly selected characteristics).

🟩 When saving, the application warns the user if the file exists - if they approve, a set of shapes will be saved to the existing file.

🟪 When exiting, the application warns the user if there is unsaved work and exits only if they approve. 

🟨 **UPDATE:** Now there is no need to save the set of shapes if it was read from a file!
