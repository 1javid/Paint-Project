# About

```
ðŸŸ¥ A desktop application that lets the user generate a selected number of random shapes.

ðŸŸ¦ The user can save/load the current set of shapes for durability. Anytime later, they can open the existing set
   to generate shapes (the same shape with randomly selected characteristics).

ðŸŸ© When saving, the application warns the user if the file exists - if they approve, a set of shapes will be saved 
   to the existing file.

ðŸŸª When exiting, the application warns the user if there is unsaved work and exits only if they approve.
